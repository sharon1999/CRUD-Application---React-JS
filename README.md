# CRUD App using React JS

An application to perform Create, Read, Update and Delete Operations in React JS.
This application also uses json-server npm package to store the data in a json file which can be used as a local server. On each of the CRUD operations an API call is also done so that the data is saved in the backend i.e the JSON file.
